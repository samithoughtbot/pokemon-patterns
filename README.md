## Pokemon Patterns

Pokemon Patterns is an investment-time project to help me become more confident with using coding design patterns. 

Contrary to best practice I will be specifically designing towards patterns instead of allowing them to manifest organically.

At it's core, this app will create Pokemons (original 150 only!!) and allow them to evolve to reach their end-state.
